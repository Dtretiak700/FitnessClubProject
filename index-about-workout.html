            <p class="text">Boxing is a fantastic workout for PT clients or solo gym-goers. It requires speed, agility, fitness, power, endurance and ultimate mental toughness. Boxing has a potential burn rate of 13 calories a minute, which makes for quite an impressive workout if you want to get a fighter’s physique. Boxing takes on other cardio activities such as cycling and running and works predominantly on the upper half of the body.</p>
